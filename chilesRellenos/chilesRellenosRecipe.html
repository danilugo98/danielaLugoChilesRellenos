                <p>
                    Chiles Rellenos have been a part of my family's culinary traditions for as long as I can remember. My mom and grandma would often make them, but despite growing up with them, I was never interested in trying them. Being a picky eater, I tended to stick to what I knew. However, that all changed when I moved away for college. My mom encouraged me to try the dish, telling me that I wouldn't know if I liked it until I tried it. With a little reluctance, I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised. It was a shame that I had missed out on such a delicious dish for so long. Determined to make up for lost time, I learned how to make Chiles Rellenos myself and have since introduced the dish to my non-Mexican friends. They love it as much as I do, and it has become a staple in our family dinners.

                <h2 id="h21">The Origins of Chiles Rellenos</h2>
                <p>
                    The chile relleno, literally "stuffed chile" is a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. In 1858, it was described as a "green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs". Chile Relleno is a typical Mexican dish made from whole chile poblano, roasted directly over fire or on a griddle or comal, then stuffed with various ingredients. However, it varies per person/chef, and wrapped in a layer of battered eggs and fried. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    This chili is grown in most of Mexico and is an important ingredient in many regional recipes. It goes by different names depending on the area: chile jaral, chile joto, chile Esmeralda, chile miahuateco, chile gordo, and chile para rellenar. It has an intense dark green shiny color and a fleshy and elongated shape. It has a lot of flavors and is slightly spicy. This pepper is usually roasted regardless of the dish.

                <p><b><i>Follow These Instructions For A Great Mexican Dish.</i></b></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Turn a gas burner on medium-high. Char the chiles on the burner grate, turning with tongs. Or char the chiles under the broiler.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Let them soften.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Transfer the charred chiles to a plastic bag and close. Let stand 20 minutes. The chiles will steam in the bag, making them soft and easy to peel.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Gently remove as much skin as possible. It's okay if a few flecks remain-they'll add flavor, so don't rinse them off!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Using a paring knife, make a slit across the top of a chile just below the stem, leaving the stem intact. Starting from the middle of the slit, slice lengthwise down to the tip of the pepper (cut through only one layer). Open the chile like a book and pull out the seeds and inner membranes. You may need to use a paring knife to loosen the top of the seedpod. Repeat with the remaining chiles.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Stuff the chiles with cheese. Fold in the sides to cover the filling, then thread 2 toothpicks across the seam to form an X. You will probably need to make a second toothpick X to secure each chile so the filling doesn't leak out when you fry.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Mix the batter. Beat the egg whites with a mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the egg yolks and beat for 3 more minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Heat about ½ - 1 inch of vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F.
                    </li>
 
                    <li>
                        Dredge: Pour flour into a shallow dish and season with salt to your liking. One at a time, coat the stuffed chiles with the flour.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Batter: Holding each chile by the stem, lower it into the egg batter to cover it completely. Let any excess batter drip off.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fry: Add the chiles to the hot oil, 1 or 2 at a time; fry, flipping once with tongs, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Eat!
