                <p>
                    Chiles Rellenos have been a part of my family's culinary traditions for as long as I can remember. My mom and grandma would often make them, but despite growing up with them, I was never interested in trying them. Being a picky eater, I tended to stick to what I knew. However, that all changed when I moved away for college. My mom encouraged me to try the dish, telling me that I wouldn't know if I liked it until I tried it. With a little reluctance, I took a bite and was pleasantly surprised. It was a shame that I had missed out on such a delicious dish for so long. Determined to make up for lost time, I learned how to make Chiles Rellenos myself and have since introduced the dish to my non-Mexican friends. They love it as much as I do, and it has become a staple in our family dinners.

                <h2>The Origins of Chiles Rellenos</h2>
                <p>The chile relleno, literally "stuffed chile" is a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. In 1858, it was described as a "green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs". Chile Relleno is a typical Mexican dish made from whole chile poblano, roasted directly over fire or on a griddle or comal, then stuffed with various ingredients. However, it varies per person/chef, and wrapped in a layer of battered eggs and fried.
